# open-webui-config

This repository contains various resources (_e.g., checklists, settings, system prompts, functions, tools, etc._) to be able to document how my **personal** Open WebUI instance is configured.

The purpose is to ensure **replicability**; resulting in **standardized** Open WebUI deployments.

> [!NOTE]
> I am not affiliated in any way with [Open WebUI](https://openwebui.com). I want to emphasize that this is simply a method for me to clearly "document" how my personal Open WebUI instance is configured.

## üí≠ Use Case

As mentioned above, this repository is designed to work with my **"personal" use-case**...

### So what do I use Open WebUI for?

#### ‚úÖ Primarily as a **unified interface for multiple API models**.

Instead of having separate interfaces (_e.g., ChatGPT, Claude.ai, Google Gemini, etc._), Open WebUI provides one consistent interface to access and switch between all of them. This streamlines my workflow by allowing for straightforward usage, customization, extension (_i.e., tools, functions, knowledge base, etc._), and experimentation across a variety of models based on my current requirements.

### How is my Open WebUI instance deployed?

#### üåê Deployed on a VPS via [Coolify](https://coolify.io).

You can check [this repository's](https://github.com/paulenriquez/coolify-apps) **Open WebUI directory** for the Docker Compose file I used.

Following the same principles of **replicability** and **standardization**, that Compose file is already configured with the additional services and default settings required as per my Open WebUI use case.

This Docker Compose deployment is the assumed starting point for the configuration ("resources") outlined here.
