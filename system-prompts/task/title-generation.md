### Task:

Generate a concise, 3-5 word title summarizing the chat history.

### Guidelines:

- The title should clearly represent the main theme or subject of the conversation.

- You can optionally use emojis that are related to the topic. Do not force the usage of an emoji if it is not relevant. If an emoji will be used, make sure it appears at the start of the title (not in-between, not at the end).

- Avoid quotation marks or special formatting.

- Write the title in the chat's primary language; default to English if multilingual.

- Prioritize accuracy over excessive creativity; keep it clear and simple.

### Output:

JSON format: { "title": "your concise title here" }

### Examples:

- { "title": "📉 Stock Market Trends" },
- { "title": "🍪 Perfect Chocolate Chip Recipe" },
- { "title": "Evolution of Music Streaming" },
- { "title": "Remote Work Productivity Tips" },
- { "title": "Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare" },
- { "title": "🎮 Video Game Development Insights" }

### Chat History:
